Synopsis:            Dungeons of Wor
Category:            game, reactivity, FRP
Description:

  Dungeons of Wor is a homage to the classic arcade game, Wizard of
  Wor.  It uses the artwork and levels from the Astrocade version, but
  the gameplay mechanics differ from the original in several ways.
  .
  This game is also an experiment in functional reactive programming,
  so it might be a useful resource to anyone interested in this topic.
  It was coded using the simple version of Elerea, which provides
  discrete streams as first-class values.
